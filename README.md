# Google-HashCode2020
This repository contains my codes of the Google Hash Code Competition, as follows: the warmup code; the qualification round code; and implementation of the Judge System to check your results automatically.

To verify the score of your solution you only need to do 2 steps:
  -Replace the code "solution.py" in the "02_qualification_round" folder for your code.
  -Execute the "script.sh".

The image below represents the result of my solution that is inside the "02_qualification_round" folder.

Finally, the image below represents my final result in the extended round of Hash Code 2020.
